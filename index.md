We are hosted in the [Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology](https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/research-departments/integrative-structural-and-computational-biology/) at [The Scripps Research Institute](https://www.scripps.edu/) on the sunny seaside La Jolla, California campus.

   We use protein design and integrative computational approaches to challenge our understanding of biomolecular structure, function, and physical chemistry.  
<br>
   Our research focuses on the complex molecular features transmembrane (TM) domains use to direct protein functional and structural states.  We use data-driven design of synthetic membrane proteins to isolate important TM sequence-structure motifs for focused and transparent biophysical studies, embedding specific chemical features within our simple engineered model molecules.  Another theme in the lab is dissecting the active roles TM domains play in essential biological processes, for which we apply bioinformatics, molecular simulations, and custom engineered chemical biology tools that target cellular proteins directly at their lipid-embedded regions.
