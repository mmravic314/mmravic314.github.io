Hello World.  We are hosted in the [Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology](https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/research-departments/integrative-structural-and-computational-biology/) at [The Scripps Research Institute](https://www.scripps.edu/) on the sunny seaside La Jolla, California campus.

We use protein design and integrative computational approaches to challenge our understanding of biomolecular structure, folding, and physical chemistry.  Our research focuses on delineating the active roles proteins' transmembranes domains play in biochemical events and disease through engineering synthetic membrane proteins and chemical biology tools targeting proteins directly at their lipid-embedded regions.
