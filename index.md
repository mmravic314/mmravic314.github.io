We are hosted in the [Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology](https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/research-departments/integrative-structural-and-computational-biology/) at [The Scripps Research Institute](https://www.scripps.edu/) on the sunny seaside La Jolla, California campus.

   We use protein design and integrative computational approaches to challenge our understanding of biomolecular structure, function, and physical chemistry.  
<br>
   Our research focuses on data-driven design of synthetic membrane proteins.  We engineering proteins to serve as simple model molecules to ask fundamental biophysical questions or custom chemical biology tools targeting cellular proteins directly at their lipid-embedded regions.  An overarching theme in the lab is studying the complex molecular features of transmembrane domains and their active roles in essential biological processes.
