   Hello World.  We are hosted in the [Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology](https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/research-departments/integrative-structural-and-computational-biology/) at [The Scripps Research Institute](https://www.scripps.edu/) on the sunny seaside La Jolla, California campus.

<br>
   We use protein design and integrative computational approaches to challenge our understanding of biomolecular structure, function, and physical chemistry.  
<br>
   We study the complex molecular features of transmembrane domains and thier active roles in natural and disease-causing biological processes.  Our research focuses on data-driven design of synthetic membrane proteins as simple model molecules to ask fundamental biophysical questions and engineering custom chemical biology tools targeting proteins directly at their lipid-embedded regions.
