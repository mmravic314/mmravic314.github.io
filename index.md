Hello World.  We are hosted in the [Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology](https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/research-departments/integrative-structural-and-computational-biology/) at [The Scripps Research Institute](https://www.scripps.edu/) on the sunny seaside La Jolla, California campus.

We use protein design and integrative computational approaches to challenge our understanding of biomolecular structure, function, and physical chemistry.  Our research focuses on engineering synthetic membrane proteins as simple model molecules to ask fundamental biophysical questions and creating custom chemical biology tools targeting proteins directly at their lipid-embedded regions.  We study the complex molecular features and active roles of transmembrane domains in both natural and disease-related biochemical events.
