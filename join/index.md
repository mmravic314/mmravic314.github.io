# Join the Mravic Lab
Our lab welcomes applicants from any race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender identity, gender expression, caregiver and family commitments, political affiliation, sexual orientation, and eligible age or disability status.  Contact Marco for exploratory inquiries or check [for posted positions.](https://www.scripps.edu/careers/)

We strive to provide excellent training across a wide range of computational and experimental techniques.

<br/>
<br><br>
## Graduate Students
<br>
Scripps students apply to a single graduate program [(Skaggs Graduate School of Chemical and Biological Sciences)](https://www.scripps.edu/careers/) and do not apply directly to labs.  Admitted Scripps PhD  students rotate through 3 labs and choose a thesis lab.  We are currently recruiting students.  Rotations can be entirely computational (remote), experimental, or hybrid (wet/dry lab). Contact mmravic (AT) scripps.edu

<br>
## Postdoctoral Fellows
<br>
Inquiries about Postdoctoral positions should be emailed directly to mmravic (AT) scripps.edu. Candidates will be encouraged to explore applying for extramural fellowships to support their research.

<br>
## Other 
<br>
We are open to undergraduate interns, foreign exchange students, sabbatical visitors from academia and industry, post-bac technicians, and other arrangements in the lab.  Please contact Marco to discuss
