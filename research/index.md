# Membrane protein design & molecular biophysics 


We pair biophysical theory (energy calculations + atomic simulations) with informatic mining of molecular databases to derive data-driven hypotheses for how membrane proteins fold.  This engineering approach allows us to stabilize new custom membrane proteins and novel lipid-embedded protein-protein interaction partners from scratch.   <br><br>


##### We use computational design alongside protein chemistry, NMR, crystallography, and biophysical techniques to challenge our understanding of membrane protein physical chemistry and molecular events in disease.

### Design of simple synthetic model membrane proteins to directly test fundamental biophysical questions
<br>
<div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">

We are interested in the design  principles for constructing membrane proteins, which we then apply to engineering custom synthetic proteins for biotechnology applications or to understand natural proteins in disease.  Classically, biophysics & biochemistry researchers try to assess general theories by studying specific well-known model membrane proteins which are often large, complex, and poorly behaved (a PhD student's nightmare) thus can cloud biochemical interpretation.  We instead use protein design as an approach to construct small simple synthetic membrane proteins as easy-to-study model proteins, custom made to ask direct and basic and generalized 'textbook' questions concerning protein physical chemistry in the unfamiliar non-aqueous environment of lipid bilayers.

### Bioinformatic data mining & molecular dynamics simulations of membrane proteins
<br>
<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1">

We mine databases of biomolecular structures to reveal trends of how protein atomic groups preferrentially interact, informing our design of new functional and stably folded proteins.  Our groups is focused on computational approaches for integrating sequence-structure relationships into atomic models for both synthetic and natural membrane proteins.  We pioneer approaches to inegrates a myriad of distinct biochemical data into atomic protein models and molecular dynamics simulations in efforts to reveal relevant protein conformations, stabilizing motifs, and dynamics instrumental to stucture, function, and evolution - typically within the hydrophobic water-devoid lipid membrane milieu.
